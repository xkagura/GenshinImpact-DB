It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff.

The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\nMistsplitter Reforged: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use Harbinger of Dawn instead and give your Mistsplitter Reforged to another sword DPS character.\nFreedom-Sworn: Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better Freedom-Sworn holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.",

Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\nNoblesse Oblige (4): If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo.

Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds).

As such, this weapon is recommended only with a good shielder.\nSlingshot [R5]: This ranking is assuming you're using either Yun Jin or Bennett in your team. While using both Yun Jin and Bennett, this weapon can potentially beat Rust [R5].\nAmos' Bow: This weapon's ranking is assuming low stacks of its passive due to you ideally being close to enemies to consistently hit all attacks in your combo. When at 3 stacks, this weapon can be close to Slingshot [R5]. Use it if it's already built for another character and you don't want to invest in Slingshot just for Yoimiya.\nRust: At [R4] this weapon performs better than Polar Star, and at [R5] performs better than Aqua Simulacra.",
        "ArtifactChoices": "Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4): This set is her Best in Slot in the vast majority of situations even when considering inconsistent Burst usage (once every 3-4 rotations).\nCrimson Witch of Flames (4): Usable in Vaporize teams and can be her Best in Slot for teams where she procs Vaporize and Overload (such as teams with a Fischl flex or Fischl + Beidou taser core)\nEchoes of an Offering (4): This set has a lot of caveats that generally warrant it being a subpar choice. Its effects proccing is tied to your connection to the servers, so if your ping is above 100 and/or you have an unstable connection (fluctuations), you should avoid this set. Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporize teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her vaporized hits).\nRetracing Bolide (4): This set is only recommended to be used with a shielder. This set is also very resin inefficient, so its not recommended to farm for this set specifically.\nCrimson Witch of Flames (2) +18% ATK set (2): While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.",
        "ArtifactStats": "Elemental Mastery: A good option if Yoimiya is triggering Vaporize and/or Overload. Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.",
        "TalentNotes": "Her Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4) without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness."

Yun Jin's Elemental Burst grants nearby party members 30 stacks of additional flat damage bonus on Normal Attacks which scales with Yun Jin's current DEF.

Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.\n\nNote that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.",

Though it can be an awkard set to utlize well without extending rotation times, since the Holder of the set (Zhongli in this case) has to pickup the shard for the buff to take effect.\nDeepwood Memories (4): This set works best in Dendro reaction focused teams (Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom/Spread) that prefer having Deepwood Memories on Zhongli so that they can run more damage focused sets such as Gilded Dreams / Flower of Paradise Lost instead for the highest overall damage gain. That said it means keeping the enemies near your pillar's to have good uptime on the Dendro resistance shred effect, which can be difficult with no grouping abilities in a team.\nInstructor (4): This set is usually only used in a few heavily reaction focused teams, such as Ganyu Melt or Hu Tao Vape, where you're maximising your damage in exchange for a stronger shield.
